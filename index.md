## About Me

Hello, world! I am a **Data Analyst** with a strong background in both technical roles and problem-solving. My career started in the British Army, where I served in Iraq and Afghanistan and as an instructor at the Infantry Training Centre. I learned discipline, attention to detail, and effective communication, which I now use to make sense of data.

### My Journey

After the Army, I worked as a **Technical Operator**. My job was to keep a battery production line running smoothly, finding and fixing any problems along the way. This taught me a lot about process improvement and hands-on troubleshooting. I spent two years traveling in Australia and South East Asia before returning to the UK to study **Computer Science**.

### Moving into Data Analysis

I recently completed **Le Wagon's Data Analytics Bootcamp** accredited by BCS The Chartered Institute for IT, and became interested in data analysis through exploring tools like **Power BI**, **Python**, and **SQL**. I enjoy finding patterns in data and using it to tell a clear story. Recently, I have worked on projects such as:

- **Ecommerce Data Analysis**: Using Power BI to find trends in customer behaviour and sales.
- **Sleep and Productivity Study**: Working with others to look at how stress and sleep affect workers' alertness and productivity.

### My Aim

I want to make data easy to understand, so people can use it to make smart choices. I am always looking for ways to make data clear and useful.
