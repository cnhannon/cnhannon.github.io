**Biography**

Hello, world!
I'm Chris. A **British Army Veteran** with combat experience in Iraq and Afghanistan. Since leaving the Armed Forces I turned to more technical occupations. Working as a **technical operator** fixing and maintaining a state of the art cell battery assembly production line. And returning to education to obtain a **Certificate of Higher Education in Computer Science** from Sunderland University. Most recently I have completed a **Le Wagon Data Analytics Bootcamp** accredited by BCS Chartered Institute for IT.



Your biography text goes here. Feel free to talk about your background, education, skills, and what you're passionate about. This could be a paragraph or two, depending on how detailed you want to get.
